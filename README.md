Hello there! 

In the context of the Advanced-Topics-in-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science course at ETH I've created a presentation on the paper [Exploring the Limits of Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02410).

I've uploaded it [here](https://targetsm.github.io/exploring_the_limits_of_language_modeling.pdf) in hope can help someone understanding the paper better.

Cheers,
Gabriel
