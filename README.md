Hello there! 

In the context of the Advanced-Topics-in-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science course at ETH I've created a presentation on the paper [Exploring the Limits of Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02410).

I've uploaded it under https://targetsm.github.io/exploring_the_limits_of_langauge_modeling.pdf in hope it can be of use of someone trying to understand the paper.

Cheers,
Gabriel
